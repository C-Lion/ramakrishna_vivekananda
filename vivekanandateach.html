        <h2>Universal Teachings of Swami Vivekananda</h2>

        <h3>See God In All</h3>
        <p>This is the gist of all worship - to be pure and to do good to others. He who sees Siva in the poor, in the weak, and in the diseased, really worships Siva, and if he sees Siva only in the image, his worship is but preliminary. He who has served and helped one poor man seeing Siva in him, without thinking of his cast, creed, or race, or anything, with him Siva is more pleased than with the man who sees Him only in temples.  </p>

        <h3>God Is Within You</h3>
        <p>It is impossible to find God outside of ourselves. Our own souls contribute all of the divinity that is outside of us. We are the greatest temple. The objectification is only a faint imitation of what we see within ourselves.</p>

        <h3>Perservere In Your Search For God</h3>
        <p>To succeed, you must have tremendous perseverance, tremendous will. "I will drink the ocean," says the persevering soul, "at my will mountains will crumble up." Have that sort of energy, that sort of will, work hard, and you will reach the goal.</p>

        <h3>Trust Completely In God</h3>
        <p>Stand up for God; let the world go.</p>

        <h3>Love Of God Is Essential</h3>
        <p>Giving up all other thoughts, with the whole mind day and night worship God. Thus being worshipped day and night, He reveals himself and makes His worshippers feel His presence.</p>
