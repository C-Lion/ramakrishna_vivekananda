        <h2>Swami Adiswarananda</h2>
        <h3>Minister - 1973-2007</h3>

        <p>Swami Adiswarananda (1925-2007) was born in West Bengal, India. He received his undergraduate degree and Master's degree from the University of Calcutta. During his student days he was inspired by Swami Vivekananda and his call to the "service of God in man." In 1954 he joined the monastic Order of Sri Ramakrishna and was ordained a monk in 1963. As a monk, he served the Order in various capacities in its educational and cultural centers. He taught religious subjects for several years at one of the premier colleges of the Order, the Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira at Belur, West Bengal, India. In 1966 he was sent to the Advaita Ashrama at Mayavati in the Himalayas, where he was Editor of Prabuddha Bharata: Awakened India, the English-language monthly journal on religion and philosophy published by the Order. He served in that capacity until 1968, when he was sent by the Order to the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center of New York to assist Swami Nikhilananda. Upon the passing away of Swami Nikhilananda in 1973, Swami Adiswarananda became the Minister and Spiritual Leader of the Center, a post that he held until his passing away in 2007.</p>
