          <p class="width50">In celebration of the 145th birthday of Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi, (December 1998), we present this exhibition of prints as an artist’s interpretation of the Vedantic concept of the Motherhood of God. First presented in 1994 at New York’s noted Printmaker’s Workshop Gallery, the artist dedicated these works to the Great Master Sri Ramakrishna, Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi, Swami Vivekananda, and the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center of New York. The artist, whose work is represented in many collections throughout the United States and abroad, is the recipient of a number of major awards and in 1998 was featured in a Public Television documentary about the Printmaker’s Workshop.</p>
          <h3>The Artist's Statement: The Mother of the Universe</h3>
          <p class="width50">These graphics teach us that ours is not a life governed by the outside world but lived in the upper reaches of spiritual life, where God as Mother is active in a process which is eternal and unchanging. In these suites of prints, the Mother of the Universe is the invisible power in prayer and meditation. Traditionally, in India, the Mother of the Universe is illustrated as the blue-black image embodying the powers of creation, preservation and destruction. Each suite consists of ten 18" x 18" prints joined together by a single thread. Formed into folded panels, the prints are approached as geometrically changing forms, repeated as squares and rotated circles. Each panel, like a folded book, is a prayer or mantra that in essence represents the Divinity as the One who becomes manifested as the Many. The Divine Mother of the Universe is no other than the Absolute – the Brahman of Vedanta.</p>
          <p class="width50">The circle symbolizes Zero. Within each of the circles are nine equal lines combining to form a harmony – the constant search for unity in diversity. God as Mother is active in an eternal and unchanging process. The Mother of the Universe is the invisible power in prayer and meditation. Unfolding as the Mother of Pearl, She gives rise to the Universe. Illustrated as the blue-black image embodying the powers of creation, preservation and destruction. She is the cosmos evolved out of chaos, the highest symbol of all forces of nature. Abstract elements portrayed as the movement of creation. A linear geometric motif. All the energies converge into and emerge from it. In the ten 18"x18" folded panels there is the use of the geometry of repeated squares and rotating circles. Each print turns to become part of the revolving universe. The circle in one print becomes the triangle in another. The one Absolute is divided into the many. In essence these hand-bound prints, joined together by a single thread, represent the one Divinity in the process of creation. The Divine Mother of the Universe is no other than the Absolute -- the Brahman of Vedanta.</p>
