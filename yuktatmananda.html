        <h2>Swami Yuktatmananda</h2>
        <p>Swami Yuktatmananda joined the monastic Order of Sri Ramakrishna in Bangalore, India, in 1978 and was ordained a monk in 1988. For more than a decade, he served at the Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya in Coimbatore, a major educational center of the Order, leading its Polytechnic College. Later, after being in charge of the Ramakrishna Institute of Moral and Spiritual Education, a teacher training college of the Order’s Mysore Center, for more than four years, the Swami was sent by the Order in January 2002 to the Advaita Ashrama at Mayavati in the Himalayas, where he served for three years as editor of Prabuddha Bharata: Awakened India, the English language monthly journal on religion and philosophy published by the Order.</p>

        <p>In May 2006 Swami Yuktatmananda was assigned by the Order to be the minister of its newly accepted branch, the Vedanta Center of St. Petersburg, Florida, where he served more than a year and a half. In December 2007, following the passing away of Swami Adiswarananda, Swami Yuktatmananda was selected by the Order to be the Minister and Spiritual Leader of the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center of New York.</p>

        <p>Swami Yuktatmananda’s writings appear regularly in the Monthly Announcements of the Center. On invitation, he lectures at religious, educational and cultural institutions in the United States and abroad.</p>
