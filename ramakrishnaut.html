        <h2>Universal Teachings</h2>

        <h3>See God In All</h3>
        <p><em>I have now come to a stage of realization in which I see that God is walking in every human form and manifesting Himself alike through the sage and the sinner, the virtuous and the vicious. Therefore when I meet different people I say to myself, "God in the form of the saint, God in the form of the sinner, God in the form of the righteous, God in the form of the unrighteous."</em></p>
        <h3>God Is Within You</h3>
        <p><em>Do you know what I see? I see Him as all. Men and other creatures appear to me only as hollow forms, moving their heads and hands and feet, but within is the Lord Himself.</em></p>
        <h3>Perservere In Your Search For God</h3>
        <p><em>There are pearls in the deep sea, but one must hazard all to find them. If diving once does not bring you pearls, you need not therefore conclude that the sea is without them. Dive again and again. You are sure to be rewarded in the end. So is it with the finding of the Lord in this world. If your first attempt proves fruitless, do not lose heart. Persevere in your efforts. You are sure to realize Him at last.</em></p>
        <h3>Trust Completely In God</h3>
        <p><em>What are you to do when you are placed in the world? Give up everything to Him, resign yourself to Him, and there will be no more trouble for you. Then you will come to know that everything is done by His will.</em></p>
        <h3>Love Of God Is Essential</h3>
        <p><em>Unalloyed love of God is the essential thing. All else is unreal.</em></p>
